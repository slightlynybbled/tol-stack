# Purpose

Library intended for easy mechanical tolerance analysis 
using Monte-Carlo-based simulation techniques.

# Project Maturity

The project API is not currently stable and will likely
continue to evolve until I like it.

# Feature Roadmap

 - ~~Single-dimension stackups~~ - The simplest and most common of 
 stackups; i.e. length. 
 - Concentricity stackups - Typically, center-to-center on a plane.
 - Material properties
   - Temperature-based stackup based on CTE of materials
 - Intuitive Python interface - This is currently being worked out.
 - Similar YAML interface - Should be readably compatible with the 
 Python interface.
 - Report generator  
 - Deployment as executable (command-line) YAML
 - Deployment as executable (GUI) ?
 - Deployment to PyPI?
