# Purpose

Library intended for easy mechanical tolerance analysis 
using Monte-Carlo-based simulation techniques.

# Project Maturity

The project API is not currently stable and will likely
continue to evolve until I like it.

# Feature Roadmap

 - ~~Single-dimension stackups~~ - The simplest and most common of 
 stackups. 
 - Two-dimensional stackups - Typically, center-to-center on a plane.
 - Material properties
   - Temperature-based stackup based on CTE of materials
 - Fit-based stackups (press-fit, slip-fit, etc.)
 - Intuitive Python interface - This is currently being worked out.
 - Similar YAML interface - Should be readably compatible with the 
 Python interface.
 - Deployment to PyPI
