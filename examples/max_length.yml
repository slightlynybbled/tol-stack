name: Clearance Arm Tolerance Stackup
description: The assembly must have a clearance between the bottom
  of the base and the bottom surface of the arm between the defined
  minimum and maximum values.

  The goal is to get 99.7% or greater of the assemblies to meet tolerance.

max length: 0.975
min length: 0.950

parts:
  - Base:
      distribution: norm
      nominal length: 0.1
      tolerance: 0.01

      comment: anticipate that this part will come in around nominal thickness
  - Riser:
      distribution: skew-norm
      skewiness: -1
      nominal length: 1.0
      tolerance: 0.01

      comment: anticipate that this part will be machined down from stock
  - Arm:
      distribution: norm
      nominal length: -0.14
