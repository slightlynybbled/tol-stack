name: Clearance Arm Tolerance Stackup
description: The assembly must have a clearance between the bottom
  of the base and the bottom surface of the arm between the defined
  minimum and maximum values.

  The goal is to get 99.7% or greater of the assemblies to meet tolerance.

parts:
  - Base:
      distribution: norm
      nominal length: 0.1
      tolerance: 0.01
      image paths: examples/max_length_files/base0.png
      comment: assume this part will come in around nominal thickness and be used as-purchased;
          thus, expect a normal distribution of parts
  - Riser:
      distribution: skew-norm
      skewiness: -4
      nominal length: 1.04
      tolerance: 0.01

      comment: part will be machined down from stock; as a result of human factors,
          assume that there will be a skew in the parts provided as the machinist will
          stop machining when parts meet tolerance
  - Arm:
      distribution: skew-norm
      skewiness: -2
      nominal length: -0.17
      tolerance: 0.01
      image paths: examples/max_length_files/arm0.png
      comment: part step to be machined down from stock; therefore, due to human factors, expect
          that there will be a slight right-skew to the distribution
